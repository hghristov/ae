Fixed issues:
	- As stated in the assignment, the fonts are used in the CSS but no webfonts were included in the project. I've added webfonts from fonts.google.com.
	- There was a syntax error in the bottom of the CSS file which I've fixed.
	- The page was missing its viewport meta tag, which is why the site looked tiny on mobile devices. The tag has been added and the issue has been resolved.
	- pseudo-elements in CSS were using single colon instead of double colon. Both syntaxes work in browsers however it's considered good practise to use :: for pseudo-elements.
	- Coloured line and logo in footer were causing horizontal scrollbar on smaller devices.
	- Replaced logo links with svg versions for retina support.
	- Added search icon.
		- I've used the non-transparent raster icon from the PSD however it would be best if a vector icon was provided or at least a high-res transparent PNG version of this icon.
	- Updated slider content breakpoint styles.
	- Added social media icons using the provided SVG sprite.
	- Added cart icon using the provided SVG sprite.
	- Added hamburger icon.
		- Used a span & CSS pseudo-elements so each element can be animated.
	- Added mobile navigation toggler js.
	- Added mobile footer styles & js.
		- Added "plus" icon using css pseudo-elements.
	- Fixed footer styles for desktop & mobile.
		- Bottom footer needed absolute positioning styles.
	- Fixed newsletter styles for mobile.
		- Input needed flex-grow.
	
Recommendations:
	- Use an automated autoprefixer to avoid writing prefixed CSS syntax manually.
	- Use CSS preprocessor and split styles into multiple smaller components.
